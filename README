# li3_htmlpurifier


## NOTE

Some one has been [created one](https://github.com/harikt/li3_htmlpurifier) before but it has been deleted current.

These codes in my local machine also have not .git directory so I don't remember it's origin version from @harikt or not.

For this version of li3_htmlpurifier, I added a script `sync.sh` download HTMLPurifier automated. Nest sub-module is quirk, and in my team `git-archive-all` not works well (same commands by two people will got different result) so I do not use git-module here.


## Usage

Libraries::add('li3_htmlpurifier');

Download the htmlpurifier library from htmlpurifier.org
Keep the all files of HTMLPurifier library inside li3_htmlpurifier/libraries/HTMLPurifier/
Sample file path will be li3_htmlpurifier/libraries/HTMLPurifier/HTMLPurifier.auto.php

Usage :

```
use \HTMLPurifier
$purifier = new HTMLPurifier();
$clean_html = $purifier->purify( $dirty_html );
```

If you need to pass $config import HTMLPurifier_Config like below

```
use \HTMLPurifier;
use \HTMLPurifier_Config;

$config = HTMLPurifier_Config::createDefault();
//set configuration options
$purifier = new HTMLPurifier($config);
$clean_html = $purifier->purify( $dirty_html );
```
